It has been two weeks since I came to the company.
I guess I can finish the Java Foundation tomorrow.
Maybe you will ask me what the weather is like today,then I will tell you that there is although a little sunshine at noon,but it is still very cold,Only 7 degrees.
I need to buy some articles for daily use in the evening,because I just make a move.
I and ZhangYangYong move to the QingShui River,but ZhuDi still takes the bus 396 to work everyday.
About my house,it was rather dirty when we moved there,but we soon cleaned it.
Finally,I hope the weather will soon change for the better,because it is so cold.
Tomorrow is another day, just go for it!
